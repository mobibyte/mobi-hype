# Problem
There are two types of people:  
1. People who want to attend events  
2. People who want to host events  

Unfortunately, at the university level, students on both sides have little time to spare to explore their options.
Students hosting don't have the experience or overhead to be able to advertise effectively.  
Students wanting to attend don't have the time to sift through hundreds of options that don't interest them to find the one that does.  

# Solution  
Mobi Bash tackles the heart of the problem head on.  
Our application offers robust filters that enables students to immediately find an event that interests them at the click of a button.  
The secret sauce in our solution happens when an event catches a student's eye.  
Once they RSVP, the student sees that they are awarded one coin.  

Because our application not only facilitates events, but merchandising for event hosts. 


# Opportunity and target market
The COVID pandemic had shaken up the industry for in person events.  
This is doubly true for the ecosystem among university organizations.  
Because in-person events among university organizations are currently healing, an opportunity has appeared for two reasons:  
1. Brand Loyalty  
2. Pick up orders

Student members become passionate fans of the their respective organization.  
Even more so when they are able to bond in person.  
Members often want to show their support by buying merchandise such as t-shirts.  
Organizations are able to save money by selling their merchandise in person instead of incurring shipping costs.  

However, in person sales can become difficult.  
Members don't often carry cash, and organizations waste energy moving supplies to events that members are not prepared to buy.
